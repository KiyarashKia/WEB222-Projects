          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <p>
            "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse" is a series of deeply heartfelt conversations about the meaning of life, truth and friendship.<br>
            Basically, it is a book written by Charlie Mackesy. It is noticeable that there is an animation based on Mackesy's book which has been created on year 2022 by Apple TV and BBC. The director is
            Peter Baynton and it goes through all the feelings of each character, even though it is a short animation.<br>
            All four characters represent different parts of the same person. Each can be considered the true depth of a person’s real character in life. 
            A boy who is curious and concerned; A mole who is enthusiastic; A fox who has been hurt and is disappointed in life and cannot trust easily anymore; And the horse which represents wisdom and patience of the assuming character who can be any of us, humans! And the relationship between our fears, hopes, courage and kindness.<br>
            Either reading the book or watching the animation, you will fall in love with each character as you surely can relate them to your inner, real side. We all have
            good and bad days; there are always ups and downs in our lives and because of them, we can be delighted, disappointed or tired. This is simply what the story is about: "There is always and still hope!"
          </p>
